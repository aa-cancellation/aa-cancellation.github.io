    <h1>Can I Cancel American Airlines and Get a Refund?</h1>

    <h2>How to Avoid American Airlines Ticket Cancellation Charges</h2>
    <p>Traveling can be unpredictable, and sometimes plans change. If you find yourself needing to cancel your American Airlines flight, understanding how to avoid cancellation charges can save you money and stress. This guide will explore several strategies, provide important information about American Airlines' policies, and highlight the support number for immediate assistance: <span class="support-number">+1-(860)-333-5393</span>.</p>

    <h2>Understanding American Airlines Cancellation Policies</h2>
    <p>Before diving into how to avoid cancellation fees, it's crucial to familiarize yourself with American Airlines’ cancellation policies. Typically, the following rules apply:</p>

    <h3>1. 24-Hour Cancellation Policy</h3>
    <p>American Airlines allows customers to cancel their tickets within <strong>24 hours</strong> of booking for a full refund, provided the flight is at least two days away. If you need to cancel, doing so within this window can save you from any charges.</p>

    <h3>2. Non-Refundable Tickets</h3>
    <p>Most economy tickets are non-refundable, meaning if you cancel, you may lose the entire ticket price. However, you might be eligible for a flight credit that can be used for future travel.</p>

    <h3>3. Refundable Tickets</h3>
    <p>If you purchase a refundable ticket, you can cancel your flight without incurring a fee. These tickets are typically more expensive but offer greater flexibility.</p>

    <h3>4. Basic Economy Tickets</h3>
    <p>These are the most restrictive tickets. Changes and cancellations are often not permitted, so it's best to review your ticket type carefully.</p>

    <h3>5. Travel Insurance</h3>
    <p>Consider purchasing travel insurance when booking your flight. This can help cover cancellation fees for specific reasons, such as illness or emergencies.</p>

    <p>For personalized assistance with cancellations, you can always contact American Airlines at <span class="support-number">+1-(860)-333-5393</span>.</p>
